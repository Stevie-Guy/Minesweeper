## About this project
I randomly came across a programming problem with the name "Minesweeper puzzle" and the idea "Let's program Minesweeper" instantly popped up.

## How to play
[Install](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) Visual Studio Code for Windows 10 and the [GCC Compiler](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/)(Windows 10 is necessary). 
Download `Minesweeper.cpp` and put it in a folder, compile and run `Minesweeper.cpp`, then find the file `Minesweeper.exe` that was created in the same folder as the source code, run the .exe file and you are good to go. Use **WASD** to change direction and collect @ to grow. By the way, you can go through walls.
